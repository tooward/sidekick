# Authentication

A basic implementation of the authentication for Firebase using AngularFire. Currently supports email authentication only.

# TODO
- [ ] Add OAuth for Google and other providers. Use the [Firebase UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web) for this.
- [ ] Isolate into a standalone module.

# Sources

- Used this tutorial for Firebase Auth https://www.positronx.io/full-angular-firebase-authentication-system/. Note have to use BOTH init's for Firebase to get this to work. Need to migrate it to the new process (note the use of /compat/ in path of libraries used).
